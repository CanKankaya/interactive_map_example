# Interactive Map Example

- This project is an interactive map example built with Flutter. It displays a world map with supported countries, and supported countries show the cities/districts in detail when selected. 
 - I kept the project as simple as possible for anyone that needs an interactive map of their country, simple extract from supported countries.

- [countries_world_map](https://pub.dev/packages/countries_world_map)
